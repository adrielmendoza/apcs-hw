Notes for 5/29/14:

Graph Algorithms - Search
1. Add start node to frontier and mark as visited
2. while frontier isn't empty and solution not found
	n = remove next node from frontier
	for v in each unvisited neighbor of n
		mark r as visited
		add r to frontier
Breadth first Search (BFS): frontier is a queue
Depth first Search (DFS): frontier is a stack
^^ both of these are blind searches

Guided/Heuristic search

Best first search
	ex: heuristic - minimum of the Euclidean distance from the node to the exit
	may be substituted with Manhattan distance
	frontier - PriorityQueue
