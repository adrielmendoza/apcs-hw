Whatâ€™s the difference between a HashMap and a HashSet?
A HashMap implements the Map interface and maps keys to values. A HashSet implements the Set interface and stores Objects. 
HashMap adds values using the .put() method, while HashSet uses .add().
HashMap also tends to be faster than HashSet because of the usage of the unique key. 

How is HashMap implemented?
The backbone of a HashMap is an array. 
The HashMap interface features two important methods: put(K key, V value) and remove(Object key). put(key, value) returns a Set view of the keys contained in the particular map. remove(key) removes the mapping for the specified key from the particular map if present.

How is TreeMap implemented?
The backbone of a TreeMap is a binary tree.
The TreeMap interface also uses the same methods. 

What is the Java builtin Heap data structure called?
This date structure is known as the PriorityQueue.
